Adds a new WorkGiver for hauling, which prioritises clearing stockpiles of blockages that may if there are extra products from doing a bill at a work table.

The behaviour of this WorkGiver is as follows:
If an item doesn't belong in a stockpile, first a check is made to see if there is a valid stockpile within a radius of 18 of the item. If so, the item will be taken there.
If no valid stockpile was found or no stockpile with enough space was found, the item will be dumped in a small radius of its original position. This position will not be next to or in a doorway or on top of a trap.

The clearing routine by default runs at a higher priority (85) than hauling corpses (corpses can block stockpiles, no reason not to haul those) but at a lower priority than burying and stripping corpses.

In the mod settings, you can configure the radius in which to search for matching stockpiles, between 1 and 25. There is also a debug mode toggle, please don't use this unless you're troubleshooting the mod.

[Version 1.0.7]
